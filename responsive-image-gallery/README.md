# Responsive Image Gallery

As part of my Go2Cod Web Development Internship, I built a **Responsive Image Gallery** using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project helped me enhance my skills in building responsive and interactive web applications, focusing on clean UI design and smooth user experience.

## Key Features

- ✨ **Grid Layout**: Display images in a grid that adapts to different screen sizes (responsive design).
- ✨ **Lightbox Functionality**: Click an image to view it in fullscreen. Click outside the image to close the lightbox.
- ✨ **Responsive Design**: The gallery is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly on any device.
- ✨ **Smooth Transitions**: Ensure smooth transitions and interactions, including hover effects on images.
- ✨ **Clean & User-Friendly UI**: Focused on creating an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and creating responsive, utility-first layouts.
- **JavaScript**: For handling interactivity, including the lightbox functionality.

## Installation
